# Preventing-Stress-Related-Health-Problems-in-Nurses-During-the-COVID-19-Outbreak-Through-Stress-Detection
Descriptions:
This study presents a multimodal sensor dataset for detecting ongoing stress in nurses aiding COVID-19 patients. The dataset is made up of real-time physiological signals gathered from several sensors, which are then combined and preprocessed to identify features that influence stress levels. There are three types of stress: no stress, moderate stress, and excessive stress. The findings can be used to develop strategies to minimise stress and improve the well-being of healthcare personnel.
